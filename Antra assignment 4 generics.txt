1. Describe the problem generics address.
Solution : The problem of overload of methods makes code long and redundant to accomodate different parameters type and using object type looses the type safety and it will be unwanted boxing , so we use  generics which allows us to design classes or methods but defer the specification of types until class or method is declared or called.

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
Solution : List<string> stringList = new List<string>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
Solution : Two, TKey and TValue

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
Solution : False

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
Solution : Add Method

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
Solution : Remove and RemoveAt are two methods that cause items to be removed from a list

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
Solution :  we use <> after class name  and specifying the type parameter

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
Solution : False

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
Solution : True

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
Solution : True
